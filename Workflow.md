- The CSV was converted to Xarray with dimensions as time, latitude, and longitude.
- Analyse temporal and spatial distribution of Variables
- The cloud fraction and liquid water path were plotted against time


### Preparing Dataset
- [x] Scale the Variables using Min-Max Scaling 
- [x] Split the variables by a time 
- [x] Feed them into the ML models XG boost and random forest
-
